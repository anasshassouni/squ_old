		<strong><em>Sultan Qaboos College for Teaching Arabic to Non-Native Speakers: Frequently Asked Questions</em></strong></p>
</div>
<ol>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<strong>Is it possible to rent an apartment or a room near the College if I don&#39;t want to stay at your dormitory?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">
	Yes, you could; however, it is not advisable that you stay outside our dorm due to many reasons. A student has to look it up him/herself, rents also might be expensive and most of the time rooms are not furnished. In addition, if a student is going to stay outside, the College will not be responsible for providing transportation (don&#39;t forgot that&nbsp; a student is obliged to attend the extra-curricular activities SQC holds at night sometimes) &amp; dining.</p>
<ol>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<strong>Can I stay with an Omani family because I want to communicate and learn more about your culture.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">
	Unfortunately, there has been many requests regarding this and we do apologize that we don&#39;t offer such thing. However, we might have it in the future, but currently we are discussing it with the administration. If are going to have it, for sure we will put it as a residence option.</p>
<ol>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<strong>Can a couple stay in the dorm if both want to study there?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">
	Yes, they can but they should provide a document that states they are married. We could provide a separate room for a couple but they cannot bring their child with them. It is one of the housing rules here.</p>

	<strong><u>Health Care</u></strong></p>
<ol>

<ol>
	<li dir="ltr">

<ol>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<strong>Can I have my own international health insurance from my country?</strong></li>
</ol>

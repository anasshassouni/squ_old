# SQCA Archived Website (Replit-Ready)

This folder contains a clean, flat structure of the archived SQCA.edu.om website, suitable for use in Replit or static hosting.

## Usage
- Upload all files and folders in this directory to your Replit project root.
- Make sure `index.html` is at the root (not inside any subfolder).
- All images, CSS, and JS are in their respective folders for easy linking.
- You can preview the site by running a static server or using Replit's built-in web preview.

## Structure
- `index.html` and all pages at root
- `/images` and `/homepage_images` for images
- `/css` for stylesheets
- `/js` for JavaScript
- `/alcpanel` for calendar/ckeditor assets

If you need to deploy on GitHub Pages or another static host, this structure will work out of the box.
